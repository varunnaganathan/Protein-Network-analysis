Work Review – Week 3

1.Made tweaks to the graph as suggested and joint the protein backbone irrespective of cutoff distances.

2.Implemented the Shortest path calculation for C-alpha and C-beta graphs.

3.Plotted graphs like “Clustering coefficient vs cutoff” , “Average degree vs cutoffs” and “Average shortest path vs cutoff” for cutoffs ranging from 4.5 – 11.5 Amstrong with difference of 0.5 Armstrong .(Readings and plot already sent)

4.Read about the 2 ways to find out the clustering coefficient as asked by you – (The triangle method for the global clustering coefficient and the avg of clustering coefficient for each node)

5.Read about the various non covalent interactions among proteins and their distance ranges.(Readings attached in a separate file)
